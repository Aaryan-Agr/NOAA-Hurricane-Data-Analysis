# NOAA Hurricane Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes historical hurricane data from the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) dataset. It focuses on identifying trends, patterns, and impacts of hurricanes over time using R and RMarkdown.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of NOAA hurricane records.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
- Statistical analysis of hurricane intensity, frequency, and impact.
- Time series analysis to identify trends.
- Mapping hurricane paths using geospatial data.

## Dataset
The data used in this project comes from NOAA's publicly available hurricane records. The dataset includes details such as:
- Hurricane name and year
- Wind speed and pressure
- Latitude and longitude coordinates
- Category and damage estimates

## Technologies Used
- **R**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **RMarkdown**: For generating reproducible reports.
- **ggplot2**: For visualization.
- **dplyr**: For data manipulation.
- **tidyverse**: For streamlined data handling.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Aaryan-agr/noaa-hurricane-analysis.git
2. Open the project in RStudio.
3. Install dependencies if needed.
   ``` r
   install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "dplyr"))

   ```
4. Run the RMarkdown file

## Results
The analysis aims to provide insights into:

- Changes in hurricane intensity over time.
- Regional distribution of hurricanes.
- Correlations between climate patterns and hurricane activity.
## Future Improvements
- Incorporate machine learning models for predictive analysis.
- Enhance geospatial visualizations with interactive maps.
- Compare NOAA data with other meteorological datasets.
